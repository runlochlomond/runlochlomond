<span style="letter-spacing: 0.18px;">WDLT is a charitable trust that has the responsibility to deliver leisure and sport services on behalf of West Dunbartonshire Council. Our Sports Development team has organised and delivered the Children's Fun run for the last eighteen years with over six hundred children and their parents and grandparents enjoying running the route and finishing through the 10K inflatable gantry. Polaroid Eyewear supported all participating pupils with goodie bags and also provided a donation to all schools that had pupils taking part. With the closure of Polaroid, it would have been very sad to see the cancellation of the Vale of Leven 10K and Fun Run, especially after the strong partnership that existed between the two organisations.  </span>

Polaroid managed the '10K series', however the four events will no longer continue in the same format. There are plans for the Helensburgh and Dumbarton 10K's to be delivered by their respective Athletics Clubs. The Clydebank 10K has had to be cancelled for 2017 mainly due to issues with the course. <span style="letter-spacing: 0.18px;"></span> 

# Polaroid Eyewear 10K Series – a great running tradition

The Polaroid Eyewear 10K Series had grown since its first race in 1987 with around 100 runners, to up to 1,000 runners taking part in each race over the last of its 30 year run.

The series comprised of four 10K road races in May and June and set in the towns of Helensburgh, Clydebank, Dumbarton and the Vale of Leven, which were local to the Polaroid Eyewear Global Manufacturing and Distribution facility. The aim of the series is to provide a safe, well organised series of community running events that participants of all ages and abilities can enjoy.

Following the decision to close Polaroid Eyewear, the series assets have been passed to West Dunbartonshire Leisure Trust who are leading on the delivery of our Vale of Leven 10K. The event will continue to be supported by ex-Polaroid volunteers. As ever, the series was about participation - ordinary runners enjoying well organised and friendly events in West Dunbartonshire.   We’d like you to enter this year, get motivated, crack on with the training and be part of this sensational event in the runner’s calendar.

## Series History and Background

The race series was first run in 1987 in collaboration between some enthusiasts in Polaroid and some local clubs, at that time the numbers were fairly small with Dumbarton attracting around 100 or so for a three lap course. Since then, the Polaroid Eyewear 10K Series grew, and we’ve seen over 1,000 runners taking part in each race in recent years. Last year we celebrated our 30 year anniversary with record numbers.

Over the years we have been innovative, but when we offered mugs instead of medals in the late eighties, it did not go down too well! We like to think we were trend setters with 1st male and female prizes such as business class flights to the US courtesy of Northwest Airlines, also £5,000 paid to trust funds.

Vale of Leven winners over the years have included John Hanratty 1987, Peter Fleming 1990, Nat Muir 1991, Chris Robison 1993/94, Keith Anderson 1997/98, Kenyans Benson Masya 1999 & Stephen Ariga 2001\. In 2000 local athlete Glen Stewart took the honours.

Our first female winner in 1987 was Melissa Wylie, other winners have included local athlete Janet McColl 1988/89, Sandra Branney has four wins under her belt in 1990/91/92 and 1996 as well as a 1st lady veteran in 1993 and 2000, English internationalist Heather Heasman won in 1997 with Scotland’s own Yvonne Murray-Mooney was successful in 1998.

Current course records include Keith Anderson’s 29:31 in 1997, Yvonne Murray-Mooney holds the ladies record with 34.04 in 1998\. The men’s veteran record of 30:54 is held by Brian Kirkwood from 1995, however Tommy Murray was only 5 seconds outside it in 2001! The female veteran’s record is held by Sandra Branney in a time of 35:08 in 1993.

## The Vale of Leven 10K

Last in the series is the Vale of Leven 10K, which now starts and finishes at the Moss of Balloch and includes a lovely run through Balloch Country park and along the cycle path on the banks of the River Leven.

## Fun Run Festival

There is also a schools fun run that up to 13 local primary schools have participated in, and benefit from in terms of prizes towards school funds.  The runs are graded from age from toddler to primary 7 and have been supported and organised by West Dunbartonshire Leisure/Sports Development since their start.
