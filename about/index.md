#### Polaroid Eyewear 10K– a great running tradition

The Polaroid Eyewear 10K Series had grown since its first race in 1987 with around 100 runners, to up to 1,000 runners taking part in each race. Following the decision to close Polaroid Eyewear, West Dunbartonshire Leisure Trust stepped in to lead on the delivery of our Vale of Leven 10K. The race is about participation – recreational and competitive runners enjoying a well organised and friendly event.
