<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">West Dunbartonshire Leisure Trust is once again organising a Fun Run for young runners alongside the Vale of Leven 10K. The event will take place in the Moss O’ Balloch site (G83 8LE) with all participants finishing through the 10K finishing gantry.</span>

Please see the following for further information about the event.

**What is the age group for the event and can I run with my child?**

The event is open to parents with babies (in buggies) up to primary 7 aged children. Children may be accompanied by an adult during the run

**How long is the route for the run and is it safe?**

The course distance is approx. 1mile for the older age groups and there is a shorter route for younger participants. The route is all off road and goes through Balloch Castle Country Park. The route will be heavily marshalled. It’s all about having fun and inspiring our young people to get and stay active!

**My child is already registered via their school, do I need to register again on the day?**

Anyone who has pre-registered via their school and already has a race number does not need to register again on the day. Pre-registered participants should go to the holding area for their age group (this will be marked on the day)

**I’ve not pre-registered my child, can I register on the day of the event?**

Yes. Any children who have not already registered via their school need to register at the WD Leisure Gazebo between 08:00 to 08:45 on the day.

**I’m pre-registered. Where should my child go when they arrive?**

Please ensure you arrive ready to take part no later than 08:45. Holding areas will be in place for the various age groups. Your child will be directed to the relevant area designated for your child’s age group and they should wait there with the supervisors prior to taking part in a mass warm up and walking to the starting line(s). The age groups will be Parent baby, toddlers, P1-3, P4, P5, P6 and P7).

**Is there an entry fee?**

Yes. The entry fee is £2.

**Is there parking available at the event?**

For the safety of all participants there will be no parking at the event site (Moss O’Balloch) and as a result you may need to consider some extra time to travel to the venue. Balloch train and bus stations are situated very close to the event site and as a result we would advise participants to use public transport if possible.
