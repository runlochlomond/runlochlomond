    We have a long-established history of support for the 10k races in the area and are proud to continue that support with the newly named Loch Lomond 10k. We feel the event has grown stronger each year since WDL took ownership and we see our brand growing alongside events like these. Good luck to all the competitors and fun-runners on the day!
