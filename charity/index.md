# Charity Information

If you’re looking for a way to make your event count, why not raise money for Children’s Hospice Association Scotland (local charity)? The CHAS JustGiving makes fundraising easy in a few simple steps. Your online fundraising page will be ready to share by email and social media. Your friends and family can donate securely wherever they are, through their mobile phone by text message, via [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/childrenshospiceassociationscotland/) or on [JustGiving.com](https://www.justgiving.com/chas). The donations, plus any Gift Aid, are sent straight to CHAS, so you can focus on your training.
