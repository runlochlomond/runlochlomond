<p>Children’s Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS) is the only provider of respite and end of life care to children in Scotland with a life shortening condition, and their families. Today, CHAS can only reach 1 in 3 of the families across Scotland who need their support. They are determined to reach them all. But to do that, they need more specialist nurses and doctors, more trained carers, more volunteers, more specialist equipment and facilities. And that means, quite simply, that they need to raise more money. Only then can they keep the joy alive for every family as they face the cruelest challenge of all.</p>

<p>CHAS runs Scotland’s only 2 children’s’ hospices - Rachel House in Kinross, Robin House in Balloch, as well as CHAS at Home which operates throughout the country. They’re dedicated to helping families celebrate the lives of their children while they’re together. No matter how short this time may be, they are committed to making sure it’s filled with joy. With your help, they can do just that.</p>

<p>Last year their positive impact was felt by more children and families than ever before. This year, they need to do so much more and they won’t stop until every family in Scotland has the choice and opportunity to use their services. It’s support like yours which enables them to create joy in so many ways - from creating happy memories in their hospices and in family homes; to providing opportunities that would be impossible to fulfil from a hospital bed.</p>

<p>For some families, this will be the last year they have with their child, let’s keep working together to make it the very best we can. If you would like to help support families across Scotland please email support@chas.org.uk to get your fundraising pack.</p>
