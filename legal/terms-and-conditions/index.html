<h2 id="event-rules--guidelines">Event Rules &amp; Guidelines</h2>

<p>The following event rules and guidelines are intended to help produce an event which ensures the safety of all participants and meets the requirements of local government permits. West Dunbartonshire Leisure (WDL) retains the right to refuse entry to anyone declaring false information on their application, not making the required payment, or otherwise failing to meet the entry requirements. In any and all circumstances WDL retains the right to refuse entry to any person. IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY: The Race Director and the Emergency Services reserve the right to stop the event at any time, if deemed necessary. These would be in circumstances beyond our control and no refunds would be given.</p>

<p>• All participants need to complete the personal information section on the back of their race number.</p>

<p>• Participant race number bibs are specific personal identifiers and may not be exchanged with or transferred / sold to any other person. Sale and/or transfer of race entry/bibs are strictly prohibited and will result in the disqualification and/or banning of any individuals involved from future events.</p>

<p>• All entry fees are non-refundable and may not be deferred toward a future event.</p>

<p>• Registration closure is determined and announced when event participation reaches the established capacity.</p>

<p>• Customers have the right to cancel any entry made over the internet as long as it is done within 14 days of the original entry.</p>

<h2 id="event-day">Event Day</h2>

<p>• Participants must follow instructions as given from all event officials including race staff, volunteers, medical personnel and security officers throughout the duration of the event.</p>

<p>• All participants are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and courteous manner during their participation in the event. This means, for example, that urinating or defecating anywhere on or near the course shall be strictly prohibited except in toilet facilities. Anyone violating this rule of conduct shall be disqualified from the event and will be asked to leave the course.</p>

<p>• Every participant shall be provided with an event bib number, which shall be conspicuously worn on the front (and back when applicable) during the event. The event bib number is to be worn as issued. No participant shall be permitted to participate in the event without the appropriate bib number.</p>

<p>• Baby joggers, baby strollers, skateboards, Nordic sticks, rollerblades, unauthorized bicycles or any other wheeled device will not be permitted on the course.</p>

<p>• Participants must begin the event during the official recognised starting times.</p>

<p>• All participants must acknowledge and agree their personal information (including medical information entered on their race number or collected by event medical staff during or after the event) can be stored, used and disclosed by all services in connection with the organisation, promotion and administration of the event.</p>

<h2 id="the-start">The Start</h2>

<p>• Participants should assemble according to estimated finish time no less than 10 minutes prior to the race start.</p>

<p>• All participants must be positioned behind the starting line when starting.</p>

<h2 id="course-monitoring">Course Monitoring</h2>

<p>• Any participant who refuses to obey the directions of the event official, or course marshal, or who conducts himself/herself in an unsportsmanlike manner, or who is offensive by action or language to officials, volunteers, participants or spectators may be disqualified from the event and banned from future participation in any WDL event at the discretion of race officials.</p>

<p>• Any participant who has been found by a course marshal, event official or surveillance equipment to have gained an unfair advantage by intentionally shortening the route of the race (“cutting the course”) shall be immediately disqualified from the event and banned from future participation in any WDL event at the discretion of race officials.</p>

<p>• Any person who participates in the event without a current official event bib number or timing device or a bib or chip not officially assigned to him/her is subject to removal and disqualification from future events.</p>

<p>• No persons are authorized to be on the course unless they are registered participants. Therefore, no person shall be allowed to accompany a participant if he/she is not registered in the event, nor shall any participant be allowed, without the permission of the event management, to receive assistance or refreshment from anyone during the progress of the event. Any person not properly displaying an authorized and issued bib number shall be directed to leave the course.</p>

<p>• A hands-on medical examination during the progress of an event by officially designated medical personnel shall not be considered assistance and will not result in disqualification if participant is deemed medically fit. If a participant becomes ill during or after the event and/or receive medical attention or treatment either from event medical staff or any doctor or hospital, they must authorise such persons to provide details (including details of medical treatment) to the Medical Director of the Event or others authorised by him.</p>

<h2 id="participant-safety">Participant Safety</h2>

<p>• The use of wheeled devices by participants or any other person authorized to be on the course shall be strictly limited to (a) authorised and registered competitive wheelchair participants and (b) authorised course marshals on bicycles. Baby joggers, baby strollers, skateboards, rollerblades, unauthorised bicycles or any other wheeled device will not be permitted.</p>

<p>• UKA rules state the wearing of headphones, or similar devices, (other than those medically prescribed), is not permitted in races on any single carriageway road that is not wholly closed to traffic. This restriction does not apply to races held on dual carriageways provided that there are clear, structured separations between the separate carriageways. Competition Providers of races held entirely on roads closed to traffic may apply this condition where appropriate to local circumstances.</p>

<p>• Participants are responsible for their recognition and understanding of event signage, symbols and colour relating to participant maps, facilities and direction.</p>

<p>• Medical personnel authorised by the event to do so may examine any participant who appears in distress. If in the sole opinion of authorised medical personnel it is in the best interest of the participant’s health and welfare, medical personnel may remove the participant from the event.</p>

<p>• Participants must retire at once from race if ordered to do so by a member of the event’s official staff, official medical staff, or any governmental authority, including fire and police officers.</p>

<p>• Participants are responsible and assume liability for any and all medical expenses incurred as a result of training for and/or participation in the event, including but not limited to ambulance transport, hospital stays, physician and pharmaceutical goods and services.</p>

<p>• Event officials reserve the right to delay, cancel, or suspend the race due to inclement weather in accordance with Emergency Protocol on severe emergencies and/or inclement weather. No refund will be issued in these circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="result-timing">Result Timing</h2>

<p>• All participants are assigned a chip timing device – this is embedded into your running number.</p>

<p>• The official times shall be recorded from the start of the race by the starting gun to the point where the participant crosses the finish line. Times shall be rounded to the next highest second. Net times shall not be used for any purpose regarding professional athletes or Top 100 participants.</p>

<p>• Official times for participant’s will be the electronic timing device time (chip or net time) from when the participant’s crosses the start line to the point where the participant crosses the finish line.</p>

<p>• Participants must wear their assigned timing device continuously from start line to finish line, to receive an accurate finish time.</p>

<p>• Participant chip or net times greater than the event time requirement (1 hour 45 minutes) will not be recognised as official.</p>

<p>• Participants found to be wearing two or more timing devices during the race will be disqualified and their results will not be recorded.</p>

<p>• Participants with missing timing device times at official checkpoints will be reviewed and may be disqualified.</p>

<p>• Participants must begin the event during the official recognised starting time in order to register an official course completion time.</p>

<p>• All results will be fully available on the event website after the race.</p>

<h2 id="race-prizes">Race Prizes</h2>

<p>• In the event of an individual qualifying for a prize in more than one category they will be awarded the individual prize of the highest value.</p>

<p>• Participants are responsible for ensuring their club information is correctly entered when submitting their entry if they wish to be considered for a team prize.</p>

<p>• Unless there is prior registration of named individual teams, only one team per running club will be considered in the rankings of team prizes, using the first three from that club to make that team.</p>

<p>• The Race Director will have the final say on any dispute, and where uncertainty remains, will refer to Scottish Athletics for guidance. The organisers retain the right to defer the communication of race results in the event of uncertainty on the day of the event.</p>

<h2 id="amendmentsreservationsacknowledgements">Amendments/Reservations/Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>• Event officials reserve the right to modify, supplement or waive all or part of the event rules.</p>

<p>• Participants shall be bound by any modification or supplement of the event rules published prior to the event.</p>

<p>• Failure to follow these event rules, as may be amended, will result in immediate disqualification and removal from official results.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>All customers agree to our privacy policy.</p>

<h2 id="exception">Exception</h2>

<p>Any individual requesting a waiver of any of these rules from the event shall submit a written request no less than 30 days prior to the event date specifying the nature of and reasons for the request.</p>
