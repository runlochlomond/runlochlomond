# Terms and Conditions

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">I hereby declare that I am an amateur as defined by the SAL Laws. I will be 15 years or over on the date of the first race in the series and agree that the organizers will be in no way held responsible for any injury or illness incurred by me during or as a result of this event or for any property lost on the course or in the changing rooms. These are partly road based events and for your safety we strongly advise to run without headphones and it is not permitted to run with a buggy or pram.</span>  

## Returns & Cancellations

Refunds are available 60 days or more prior to the race minus a Â£5.00 service fee. If it is less than 60 days to the race, then there is no refund or deferment. If you are registered for a race which has multiple events, at the organisers discretion, you may be able to switch to a different event up until 5 days before race day provided that the event you are switching into has not reached its Entry Limits. Please contact us to request an event switch or refund and the team will contact you to discuss options if they are available.
