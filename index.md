The West Dunbartonshire Leisure 10K is a continuation of the Polaroid Eyewear 10K Series.

Initially we plan to continue the Vale of Leven 10K race in June, set in the Moss of Balloch, and this will include the much loved school and pre-school runs whiach are are open to all. Â  The aim is to start once again where the series began, and hopefully add events over the coming years to continue to a safe, well organised series of community running events that participants of all ages and abilities can enjoy in West Dunbartonshire.
